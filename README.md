# Bootcamp2019
My first repository at bootcamp 2019

This is a test that I can change my README.md on another cluster...

I am going to make some kind of edit

This edit is done through the GitHub website.
This is very cool! Can't you see it?

I thought this is very cool. Can't you see?

Some notes to do git:
•	mkdir test	// make a folde
•	cd test		// jump to the test folder
•	nano readme.md	// make a readme file in test
•	git add readme.md	// adds the readme file into git
•	git status 	// look at the status of the git
•	git commit -m “<comment>” 		// commits the awaiting files in git
•	git branch	// see what you have available of branches
•	git checkout-b	<name of new branch>	// creates a new branch and points into the branch
•	git clone <URL>	// cloning something on GitHub with a URL
•	git fetch	// fetch the new commit from the GitHub Website
•	git push	// pull in the new commit from the GitHub website (always use with git fetch)
branch is a human readable commit in a branch

Wow! Look at that~~
